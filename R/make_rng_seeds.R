#' Produce Reproducible Seeds for Parallel Random Number Generation
#'
#' @param count The number of RNG seeds to produce.
#'
#' @param seed A logical specifying whether RNG seeds should be generated
#' or not.  (`seed = NULL` corresponds to `seed = FALSE`).
#' If a list, then it should be of length `count` and each element should
#' consist of a valid RNG seed.
#'
#' @param debug If `TRUE`, debug output is produced, otherwise not.
#'
#' @return Returns a non-named list of `count` independent `L'Ecuyer-CMRG`
#' random seeds.
#' If `seed` is `NULL` or `FALSE`, then `NULL` is returned.
#' 
#' @example incl/make_rng_seeds.R
#'
#' @details
#' This function generates `count` independent `L'Ecuyer-CMRG` random seeds
#' that can be used as `.Random.seed` for parallel processing.  These seeds
#' are produced with help of [parallel::nextRNGSubStream()] and
#' [parallel::nextRNGStream()] using a strategy that 
#'
#' ```r
#' seed <- <initial RNG seed>
#' for (ii in seq_len(count)) {
#'   seeds[[ii]] <- nextRNGSubStream(seed)
#'   seed <- nextRNGStream(seed)
#' }
#' ```
#' This function forwards the RNG state `1 + count` times if `seed = TRUE`.
